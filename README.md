#About#

SeaHorn is a framework and a tool for verification of safety
properties for C programs. It is parameterized by the semantic
representation of the program using Horn constraints and by the
verification engine that leverages the latest advances made in
constraint solving and Abstract Interpretation. The design of SeaHorn
provides users with an extensible and customizable environment for
experimenting and implementing with new software verification
techniques.
